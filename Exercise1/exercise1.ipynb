Before starting on this programming exercise, we strongly recommend watching the video lectures and completing the review questions for the associated topics.\n\nAll the information you need for solving this assignment is in this notebook, and all the code you will be implementing will take place within this notebook. The assignment can be promptly submitted to the coursera grader directly from this notebook (code and instructions are included below).\n\nBefore we begin with the exercises, we need to import all libraries required for this programming exercise. Throughout the course, we will be using [`numpy`](http://www.numpy.org/) for all arrays and matrix operations, and [`matplotlib`](https://matplotlib.org/) for plotting.\n\nYou can find instructions on how to install required libraries in the README file in the [github repository](https://github.com/dibgerge/ml-coursera-python-assignments).",

Execute the cell to see your score up to the current section. For all your work to be submitted properly, you must execute those cells at least once. They must also be re-executed everytime the submitted function is updated.\n</div>\n\n\n## Debugging\n\nHere are some things to keep in mind throughout this exercise:\n\n- Python array indices start from zero, not one (contrary to OCTAVE/MATLAB). \n\n- There is an important distinction between python arrays (called `list` or `tuple`) and `numpy` arrays. You should use `numpy` arrays in all your computations. Vector/matrix operations work only with `numpy` arrays. Python lists do not support vector operations (you need to use for loops).\n\n- If you are seeing many errors at runtime, inspect your matrix operations to make sure that you are adding and multiplying matrices of compatible dimensions. Printing the dimensions of `numpy` arrays using the `shape` property will help you debug.\n\n- By default, `numpy` interprets math operators to be element-wise operators. If you want to do matrix multiplication, you need to use the `dot` function in `numpy`. For, example if `A` and `B` are two `numpy` matrices, then the matrix operation AB is `np.dot(A, B)`. Note that for 2-dimensional matrices or vectors (1-dimensional), this is also equivalent to `A@B` (requires python >= 3.5).",

For this dataset, you can use a scatter plot to visualize the data, since it has only two properties to plot (profit and population). Many other problems that you will encounter in real life are multi-dimensional and cannot be plotted on a 2-d plot. There are many plotting libraries in python (see this [blog post](https://blog.modeanalytics.com/python-data-visualization-libraries/) for a good summary of the most popular ones). \n\nIn this course, we will be exclusively using `matplotlib` to do all our plotting. `matplotlib` is one of the most popular scientific plotting libraries in python and has extensive tools and functions to make beautiful plots. `pyplot` is a module within `matplotlib` which provides a simplified interface to `matplotlib`'s most common plotting tasks, mimicking MATLAB's plotting interface.\n\n<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-warning\">\nYou might have noticed that we have imported the `pyplot` module at the beginning of this exercise using the command `from matplotlib import pyplot`. This is rather uncommon, and if you look at python code elsewhere or in the `matplotlib` tutorials, you will see that the module is named `plt`. This is used by module renaming by using the import command `import matplotlib.pyplot as plt`. We will not using the short name of `pyplot` module in this class exercises, but you should be aware of this deviation from norm.\n</div>\n\n\nIn the following part, your first job is to complete the `plotData` function below.

These are\nthe values you will adjust to minimize cost $J(\\theta)$. One way to do this is to\nuse the batch gradient descent algorithm. In batch gradient descent, each\niteration performs the update\n\n$$ \\theta_j = \\theta_j - \\alpha \\frac{1}{m} \\sum_{i=1}^m \\left( h_\\theta(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)}\\right)x_j^{(i)} \\qquad \\text{simultaneously update } \\theta_j \\text{ for all } j$$\n\nWith each step of gradient descent, your parameters $\\theta_j$ come closer to the optimal values that will achieve the lowest cost J($\\theta$).\n\n<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-warning\">\n**Implementation Note:** We store each example as a row in the the $X$ matrix in Python `numpy`.

Keep in mind that the cost $J(\\theta)$ is parameterized by the vector $\\theta$, not $X$ and $y$. That is, we minimize the value of $J(\\theta)$ by changing the values of the vector $\\theta$, not by changing $X$ or $y$. [Refer to the equations in this notebook](#section2) and to the video lectures if you are uncertain. A good way to verify that gradient descent is working correctly is to look at the value of $J(\\theta)$ and check that it is decreasing with each step. \n\nThe starter code for the function `gradientDescent` calls `computeCost` on every iteration and saves the cost to a `python` list. Assuming you have implemented gradient descent and `computeCost` correctly, your value of $J(\\theta)$ should never increase, and should converge to a steady value by the end of the algorithm.\n\n<div class=\"alert alert-box alert-warning\">\n**Vectors and matrices in `numpy`** - Important implementation notes\n\nA vector in `numpy` is a one dimensional array, for example `np.array([1, 2, 3])` is a vector. A matrix in `numpy` is a two dimensional array, for example `np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])`. However, the following is still considered a matrix `np.array([[1, 2, 3]])` since it has two dimensions, even if it has a shape of 1x3 (which looks like a vector).\n\nGiven the above, the function `np.dot` which we will use for all matrix/vector multiplication has the following properties:\n- It always performs inner products on vectors. If `x=np.array([1, 2, 3])`, then `np.dot(x, x)` is a scalar.\n- For matrix-vector multiplication, so if $X$ is a $m\\times n$ matrix and $y$ is a vector of length $m$, then the operation `np.dot(y, X)` considers $y$ as a $1 \\times m$ vector. On the other hand, if $y$ is a vector of length $n$, then the operation `np.dot(X, y)` considers $y$ as a $n \\times 1$ vector.\n- A vector can be promoted to a matrix using `y[None]` or `[y[np.newaxis]`. That is, if `y = np.array([1, 2, 3])` is a vector of size 3, then `y[None, :]` is a matrix of shape $1 \\times 3$. We can use `y[:, None]` to obtain a shape of $3 \\times 1$.\n<div>\n<a id=\"gradientDescent\"></a>",

   "source": "#### 3.2.1 Optional (ungraded) exercise: Selecting learning rates\n\nIn this part of the exercise, you will get to try out different learning rates for the dataset and find a learning rate that converges quickly. You can change the learning rate by modifying the following code and changing the part of the code that sets the learning rate.\n\nUse your implementation of `gradientDescentMulti` function and run gradient descent for about 50 iterations at the chosen learning rate. The function should also return the history of $J(\\theta)$ values in a vector $J$.\n\nAfter the last iteration, plot the J values against the number of the iterations.\n\nIf you picked a learning rate within a good range, your plot look similar as the following Figure. \n\n![](Figures/learning_rate.png)\n\nIf your graph looks very different, especially if your value of $J(\\theta)$ increases or even blows up, adjust your learning rate and try again. We recommend trying values of the learning rate $\\alpha$ on a log-scale, at multiplicative steps of about 3 times the previous value (i.e., 0.3, 0.1, 0.03, 0.01 and so on). You may also want to adjust the number of iterations you are running if that will help you see the overall trend in the curve.\n\n<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-warning\">\n**Implementation Note:** If your learning rate is too large, $J(\\theta)$ can diverge and ‘blow up’, resulting in values which are too large for computer calculations. In these situations, `numpy` will tend to return\nNaNs. NaN stands for ‘not a number’ and is often caused by undefined operations that involve −∞ and +∞.\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-warning\">\n**MATPLOTLIB tip:** To compare how different learning learning rates affect convergence, it is helpful to plot $J$ for several learning rates on the same figure. This can be done by making `alpha` a python list, and looping across the values within this list, and calling the plot function in every iteration of the loop. It is also useful to have a legend to distinguish the different lines within the plot. Search online for `pyplot.legend` for help on showing legends in `matplotlib`.\n</div>\n\nNotice the changes in the convergence curves as the learning rate changes. With a small learning rate, you should find that gradient descent takes a very long time to converge to the optimal value. Conversely, with a large learning rate, gradient descent might not converge or might even diverge!\nUsing the best learning rate that you found, run the script\nto run gradient descent until convergence to find the final values of $\\theta$. Next,\nuse this value of $\\theta$ to predict the price of a house with 1650 square feet and\n3 bedrooms. You will use value later to check your implementation of the normal equations. Don’t forget to normalize your features when you make this prediction!",
